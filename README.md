# Next.js 15 Unexpected JSX Error in Dynamic Route

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15 when accessing a variable directly within JSX in a dynamic route component. The error is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

The `about.js` file contains a simple component that renders a paragraph including a variable's value. Under certain circumstances, Next.js 15 throws an unexpected error when rendering this component.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. The error may or may not appear; it's inconsistent.

## Potential Causes

* **Caching:** The issue might be related to Next.js's caching mechanisms.
* **Optimization:** Next.js's optimizations might interfere with the way variables are accessed in the JSX.
* **Race Condition:**  A race condition might be at play during rendering.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates a workaround by using a functional component to handle data and passing props instead of accessing variables directly in JSX.

This demonstrates a potential issue and solution for an uncommon error that could cause unpredictability in Next.js applications.
